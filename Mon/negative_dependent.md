## What is negative dependent?

Once event1 happens, the chance of event2 happens decreases dramatically.

P(S1 and S2) << P(S1)P(S2)

P(S1 | S2) << P(S1)

Applications: Recommendation system, Compressing data

## Mathematical representation

This can be represents as a vector. The event can be represented as a vector in
space. The joined prob is then the area of the diamond shape constructed by
those two vectors.

u(S) proprosion to vol of vectors
u(S) proportion to the det of vectors
