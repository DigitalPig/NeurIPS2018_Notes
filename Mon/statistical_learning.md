## Why SLT?

SLT is about the "confidence" (of the learned conclusion). The "probable approximate correct" (PAC): Given an error range, what is the probability of the result's deviance is greater than the error?

It also can be considered as the "worst-case-scenario".

## Slide Contents

I have a lot of notes. But basically those are trying to capture the slide.
Since the slide is available now, I will omit them here.
