## Test of Time Paper

[The Tradeoffs of Large Scale Learning](https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/mloptbook-2011.pdf)

Recording can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/nipsfoundation/videos/271569366878864/) around 56min marker.

## Key Contributions

* Approximation-Optimization-Estimation Trade-offs
* If resource is limited but data scale is huge, stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD) is a good method to train your model using a small batch of data and
  use it in an iterative way.

## Development of SGD in 10 years

* One variance reduction 
* Implicit regularization with SGD
* Robust SGD

## Thoughts

* Truth not follow fashion
* Experiments are crucial
* On the proper use of mathematics: theorem should not limit creativity

## Future Problems

* Over-parameterized in learning and generalization
* The role of compositionality in AI
* The role of causality in AI
