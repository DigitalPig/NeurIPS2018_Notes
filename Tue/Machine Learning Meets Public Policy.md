AI and Machine Learning are already having a big impact on the world.
Policymakers have noticed, and they are starting to formulate laws and
regulations, and to convene conversations, about how society will govern the
development of these technologies. This talk will give an overview of how
policymakers deal with new technologies, how the process might develop in the
case of AI/ML, and why constructive engagement with the policy process will
lead to better outcomes for the field, for governments, and for society.
