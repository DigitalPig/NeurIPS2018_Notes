Key Notes:

* Dennard Scaling
* Software 1.0: Deterministic 
* Software 2.0: Probabilistic by data, no need to get 100% accuracy but the
  aggregated stats need to be correct.
* Efficiency is a trade-off between statistical efficiency (Number of
  iterations to accuracy) and hardware efficiency (number of iterations to run
  one iteration)
* SGD is the key algorithm in the ML community now. But what is the future?
* We need new Compilers etc to handle the new era of ML
